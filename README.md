# Getting Started with Create Todo App

The application offers 3t ways to group the data:

1. **By Status**: Group tickets based on their current status.
2. **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.

We can sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.
